	abstract = {In high-dimensional data settings, additional information on the features is often available. Examples of such external information in omics research are: (i) p-values from a previous study and (ii) omics annotation. The inclusion of this information in the analysis may enhance classiﬁcation performance and feature selection but is not straightforward. We propose a group-regularized (logistic) elastic net regression method, where each penalty parameter corresponds to a group of features based on the external information. The method, termed gren, makes use of the Bayesian formulation of logistic elastic net regression to estimate both the model and penalty parameters in an approximate empirical–variational Bayes framework. Simulations and applications to three cancer genomics studies and one Alzheimer metabolomics study show that, if the partitioning of the features is informative, classiﬁcation performance, and feature selection are indeed enhanced.},

	title = {Flexible co-data learning for high-dimensional prediction},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04010},
	abstract = {Clinical research often focuses on complex traits in which many variables play a role in mechanisms driving, or curing, diseases. Clinical prediction is hard when data is highdimensional, but additional information, like domain knowledge and previously published studies, may be helpful to improve predictions. Such complementary data, or co-data, provide information on the covariates, such as genomic location or p-values from external studies. Our method enables exploiting multiple and various co-data sources to improve predictions. We use discrete or continuous co-data to deﬁne possibly overlapping or hierarchically structured groups of covariates. These are then used to estimate adaptive multi-group ridge penalties for generalised linear and Cox models. We combine empirical Bayes estimation of group penalty hyperparameters with an extra level of shrinkage. This renders a uniquely ﬂexible framework as any type of shrinkage can be used on the group level. The hyperparameter shrinkage learns how relevant a speciﬁc co-data source is, counters overﬁtting of hyperparameters for many groups, and accounts for structured co-data. We describe various types of co-data and propose suitable forms of hypershrinkage. The method is very versatile, as it allows for integration and weighting of multiple co-data sets, inclusion of unpenalised covariates and posterior variable selection. We demonstrate it on two cancer genomics applications and show that it may improve the performance of other dense and parsimonious prognostic models substantially, and stabilises variable selection.},
